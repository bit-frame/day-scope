# Installing DayScope (Beta)
To get started, clone this repository to your server
```
git clone https://github.com/bit-frame/day-scope.git
```
Navigate to the ``DayScope`` directory and run the setup shell script as root. This script contains all required setup items, no other initial setup is required.
```
sudo sh setup.sh
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to finish initial setup.

Next, run DayScope using ``run.dayscope`` in the terminal:
```
run.dayscope
```
Or using node:
```
node app.js
```
On the initial startup of DayScope, you will be redirected to an onboarding page to setup DayScope. Everything else is handled automatically.
After completing onboarding, head over to ``/login`` to continue the setup process.
